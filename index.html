      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Throughout high school, I have taken the most rigorous classes possible and have maintained
       a 4.0 (4.6 weighted) during my first 3 years. I have volunteered for dozens of hours at the
        Welcome to America project where I have welcomed over 100 refugees to America by setting 
        up their TV systems (which assist in their ability to learn English) and moving furniture
         into their homes. I have played Basketball at a high level since the third grade which has
          helped shape my character by making me a hard-working and disciplined individual. I have
           skills in graphic design and coding from the classes I have taken during high school.
            I have started my own club at Seton (Table Tennis Club) and I am currently NHS President.
             Lastly, I am a National Merit Scholar Semi-Finalist for 2024.

                by greeting them at their homes and delivering

                extensive 1 on 1 interaction with the family members.
                This grants me the opportunity to learn about their
                story and how they came to America.
